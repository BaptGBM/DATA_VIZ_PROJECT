    Our exploration of the French charging network is now complete. Beyond maps and graphs, this analysis has enabled us to paint a picture of a profound transformation, marked by three key lessons.

    st.markdown("""
    The first finding is clear: France has seen **exponential growth** in its charging station network since 2020. However, this quantitative expansion masks a qualitative transformation: the network is modernizing, with a spectacular rise in fast and ultra-fast charging stations, a sign of new maturity. Nevertheless, the analysis also revealed the **limitations of declarative data**, with a lot of information missing (power, installation date), particularly among certain players. Data reliability remains a major challenge for the careful management of this transition.""")

    st.subheader("2. A Market of Giants with Opposing Strategies")
    st.markdown("""
Far from being a fragmented ecosystem, the market is **dominated by a handful of major operators** who share more than half of the market. But analysis has shown that there is not one, but several strategies for domination.  On one side are the **“local builders”** (such as Bouygues E&S), who are banking on the volume of slow charging stations in urban areas, and on the other are the **“highway sprinters”** (such as Tesla and Power Dot), who are focusing on high power for long journeys. Between the two, giants such as TotalEnergies are making their transition.""")
    st.subheader("3. A Territorial Divide That Remains to Be Bridged")
    st.markdown("""Finally, the most striking lesson is geographical. The map revealed a **“two-speed France”**, with infrastructure heavily concentrated in metropolitan areas and along major transport routes, leaving vast rural areas behind. These **“charging deserts”** are the main challenge to ensuring a fair and inclusive ecological transition for all citizens, wherever they live. """)

The success of the transition to electric vehicles in France will depend on our ability to harmonize these three aspects.""")
